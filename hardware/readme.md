## Build instructions

We list below all instructions we followed to build the cooling system for 
a GPU NVIDIA Tesla V100 and for an FPGA Xilinx Alveo U280. The setup can be easily addapted for any card with similar cooling requirements. 

### Air duct desgin and construction 


1. To guarantee mechanical stability and avoid
vibrations, the fan must be fixed at the computer case, and never at the card. To
this end, it is important to employ a computer case with a transverse bracket 
for fans as that one depicted below, which correspons to a locally sourced (Brazil) Nilko NK211 4U
rack-mounting PC case.

2. With the help of a cardboard sheet, draw the fan opening, mounting holes, and the reference marks for the 
cardâ€™s air intake, see below.
